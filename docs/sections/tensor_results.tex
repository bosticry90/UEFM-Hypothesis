\section{Tensor-Train Compression as a Coherence Diagnostic}
\label{sec:tensor-results}

We evaluate the hypothesis that informational coherence in the UEFM correlates
with low-rank tensor representations of field configurations. Using a prototype
tensor-train (TT) workflow (App.~\ref{app:tt-prototype}), we factorize a
spatio-functional field snapshot $\phi$ into a TT object of bounded rank $r$,
and compare (\emph{i}) reconstruction error $\|\phi - \hat{\phi}_r\|_F/\|\phi\|_F$
and (\emph{ii}) relative error of the coherence functional $C[\phi]$ under rank
control.

Figure~\ref{fig:tt-rank-relL2} shows that even modest TT ranks achieve
near-machine-precision reconstruction for our baseline field (Phase~3 dataset),
indicating strong compressibility. When the coherence functional is evaluated
through the TT representation, the relative error tracks the reconstruction
error (Fig.~\ref{fig:tt-rank-cohrel}), supporting the view that coherence is an
\emph{informational} property expressible through low-rank structure.

  precision at small ranks, signalling strong low-rank structure.}

  (if available in the dataset). The coherence error decays with rank similarly
  to reconstruction error, suggesting $C[\phi]$ is stable under low-rank
  compression.}

\paragraph{Implication.}
If physically relevant UEFM states remain low-rank under TT, then \emph{tensor
coherence} becomes a practical surrogate for field coherence---a measurable,
rank-controlled quantity that scales to higher dimensions with tractable cost.
